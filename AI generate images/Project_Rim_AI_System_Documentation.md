# Project Rim

**Rim** is a cutting-edge AI system that integrates multiple open-source and licensed models like **LLaMA 3.2**, **GPT-2**, and **Stable Diffusion v1.4** to perform a wide variety of tasks. With dynamic intent detection and intelligent model switching, Rim excels in both text and image generation tasks, utilizing the strengths of each model effectively.

---

## Features

- **Dynamic Model Switching**: Utilizes different AI models based on the task type:
    - **LLaMA 3.2-1B-Instruct**: Handles general text generation.
    - **LLaMA 3.2-3B**: Designed for complex language tasks.
    - **GPT-2**: Provides creative and fine-tuned text outputs.
    - **Stable Diffusion v1.4**: Generates high-quality images from textual prompts.
- **Intent Detection**: Built with **spaCy**, Rim analyzes user inputs to decide whether to process tasks as text or image generation.
- **Flask-Driven API**: A lightweight backend to manage requests to multiple models.
- **CUDA Acceleration**: Leverages GPU support to ensure optimal performance during model inference.

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- **Python**: Version 3.10 or higher.
- **CUDA Toolkit**: Ensure the compatible version for your GPU is installed for acceleration.
- **GPU (Optional)**: While not required, it is highly recommended for faster performance and GPU-dependent models like Stable Diffusion.

---

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/project-rim.git
   cd project-rim
   ```

2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment**

   ```bash
   # Create a virtual environment
   python3.10 -m venv venv

   # Activate the virtual environment
   # For Linux/MacOS:
   source venv/bin/activate
   # For Windows:
   venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**

   Install all required Python packages using the provided `requirements.txt` file:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Download Pre-Trained Models**

   Download or clone the required models:
    - **LLaMA 3.2-1B-Instruct**
    - **LLaMA 3.2-3B**
    - **Stable Diffusion v1.4**
    - **GPT-2**

   Follow their respective hosting sources (e.g., Hugging Face) and organize them into your project directory accordingly.

---

### Running Rim

1. **Start the Flask Application**

   Once everything is installed, start the Flask server:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Access the Application**

   Open your browser and navigate to:
   ```
   http://127.0.0.1:5000
   ```

3. **API Interaction**

   Use the `/api/chat` endpoint to send text prompts via a POST request. Example payload:

   ```json
   {
     "prompt": "Generate an image of a futuristic city."
   }
   ```

   The response will dynamically select the appropriate model and return either text or image outputs based on the input.

---

## Example Outputs

Below are examples of images generated by **Rim AI** using **Stable Diffusion v1.4**.

### Example 1: Tokyo at Night
*Prompt*: "A vibrant Tokyo cityscape at night, with glowing neon lights and bustling streets."

---

### Example 2: Serene Valley
*Prompt*: "A peaceful valley with lush green hills and a sunset casting a golden glow over the landscape."

![Serene Valley](AI%20generate%20images/valley.png)

---

### Example 3: Traditional Japan
*Prompt*: "A traditional Japanese village surrounded by cherry blossoms and Mount Fuji in the background, under a clear sky."

![Traditional Japan](AI%20generate%20images/japan.png)

---

### Example 4: 19th-Century Arctic Expedition
*Prompt*: "A bustling 19th-century Arctic expedition with explorers navigating through a frozen landscape of icebergs and snow."

---

### Example 5: Abstract Artwork
*Prompt*: "A surreal abstract artwork with vibrant colors, blending shapes and textures into a harmonious composition."

---

## System Workflow

1. **Input Analysis**:
- User inputs are processed through the `/api/chat` API or a simple web interface.

2. **Intent Detection**:
- **spaCy NLP** detects whether the input requires text generation or image creation.

3. **Model Selection**:
- Rim intelligently selects and routes tasks to the corresponding AI model.
    - **Text Prompts**: Routed to LLaMA or GPT-2 models.
    - **Image Prompts**: Routed to **Stable Diffusion v1.4**.

4. **Output Delivery**:
- Text responses are returned via JSON.
- Generated images are stored in the `static/images/` directory and served via the web app.
